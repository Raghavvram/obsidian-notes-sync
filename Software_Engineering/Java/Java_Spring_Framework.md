Sure! Here's a breakdown of the **core modules** in both **Spring Framework** and **Spring Boot**, which together form the backbone of modern Java application development:

### ðŸŒ± Spring Framework Modules

Spring is a modular framework, and you can use only what you need. Here are its major modules:

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Container** | Provides fundamental features like Dependency Injection (DI) and BeanFactory. |
| **Spring AOP** | Supports aspect-oriented programming for cross-cutting concerns like logging and security. |
| **Spring ORM** | Integrates with ORM tools like Hibernate, JPA, and JDO. |
| **Spring JDBC** | Simplifies database access and error handling. |
| **Spring Web MVC** | A powerful web framework for building RESTful and web applications. |
| **Spring Security** | Handles authentication, authorization, and protection against common attacks. |
| **Spring Web Flow** | Manages complex page flows in web applications. |
| **Spring Test** | Provides testing support for Spring components. |
| **Spring Messaging** | Supports messaging protocols like STOMP over WebSocket. |
| **Spring Context** | Provides context information and access to beans across the application. |

### ðŸš€ Spring Boot Modules

Spring Boot builds on Spring and adds auto-configuration and production-ready features:

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Spring Boot Starter** | Pre-configured dependencies for various use cases (e.g., `spring-boot-starter-web`, `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`). |
| **Spring Boot AutoConfigure** | Automatically configures Spring apps based on classpath settings. |
| **Spring Boot CLI** | Command-line tool to run and test Spring Boot apps quickly. |
| **Spring Boot Actuator** | Adds production-ready features like health checks, metrics, and monitoring. |
| **Spring Boot DevTools** | Enhances developer experience with hot reloading and debugging tools. |
| **Spring Boot Test** | Simplifies testing with pre-configured test libraries. |
| **Spring Boot Admin** | Community module for managing and monitoring Spring Boot apps. |

If you're building a new app, Spring Boot is usually the go-to choice because of its simplicity and rapid setup. But if you need fine-grained control or are working on a legacy system, Spring Framework gives you that flexibility.
