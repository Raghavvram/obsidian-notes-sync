Dynamic Method Dispatch (also called **Runtime Polymorphism**) is one of the core concepts of Java's object-oriented design. It refers to the process where a call to an **overridden method** is resolved **at runtime** rather than compile time.

---

### ðŸŒŸ **Definition**
Dynamic Method Dispatch allows Java to decide **which version** of a method to execute **based on the object's actual type**, not the reference type.

---

### ðŸ”§ **How It Works**
If a superclass reference points to a subclass object, and both classes have overridden a method, then the **subclass version is called** at runtime.

---

### ðŸ“˜ **Example:**
```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog();  // Superclass reference to subclass object
        a.makeSound();         // Output: Dog barks (resolved at runtime)
    }
}
```

Even though `a` is of type `Animal`, the actual object it points to is a `Dog`, so the overridden method in `Dog` is executed.

---

### ðŸ¤” **Why It Matters**
- Enables **flexibility** and **extensibility** in code
- Supports **method overriding**, a key component of polymorphism
- Commonly used in frameworks and APIs that rely on runtime behavior (e.g., Java collections, Spring framework)
