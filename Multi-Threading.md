In multithreaded Java programming, both `volatile` and `synchronized` keywords are used to manage concurrent access to shared resources, but they differ significantly in their functionality. `volatile` ensures visibility of variable changes across threads, meaning that when one thread modifies a `volatile` variable, other threads will see the updated value immediately. `synchronized`, on the other hand, provides both visibility and atomicity, guaranteeing that only one thread can access a block of code or a method at a time, preventing data races and ensuring consistent state changes. 

Key Differences:

- **Visibility vs. Atomicity:**
    
    `volatile` primarily ensures visibility of variable changes. `synchronized` provides both visibility and atomicity, meaning that changes to shared variables are immediately visible and operations are performed as a single, indivisible unit. 
    

- **Locking Mechanism:**
    
    `synchronized` uses a locking mechanism (intrinsic locks) to control access to shared resources. `volatile` does not involve locks; it relies on memory barriers to ensure visibility. 
    

- **Scope:**
    
    `synchronized` can be applied to methods or blocks of code, while `volatile` is only applicable to variables. 
    

- **Performance:**
    
    `synchronized` can introduce performance overhead due to locking and unlocking operations, especially in high-contention scenarios. `volatile` generally has lower overhead, but it might still introduce some performance impact compared to non-volatile variables due to memory barriers according to PrepInsta. 
    

- **Use Cases:**
    
    `volatile` is suitable for simple variables like flags or counters where visibility is crucial but atomicity is not a strict requirement. `synchronized` is necessary when multiple threads modify shared data structures or when operations on shared variables need to be atomic. 
    

Example:

Java

```java
class Counter {
	private volatile int count = 0; // Visibility but not atomic
	public synchronized void increment() { // Atomic and visible
		count++;
	}
	public int getCount() {
		return count; // Visibility only
	}
}
```

In this example, `increment()` is synchronized, ensuring that only one thread can modify the `count` variable at a time, preventing data races. The `count` variable is declared as `volatile` to ensure that all threads see the latest value when reading it, but incrementing it requires `synchronized` to maintain atomicity.
