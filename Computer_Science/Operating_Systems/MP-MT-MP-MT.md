## 🔄 Multiprogramming

**Goal:** Maximize CPU utilization by keeping the CPU busy while one program is waiting (e.g., for I/O).

- Introduced in early OS designs (mainframes).
- Only one program runs on the CPU at a time; others wait in the queue.
- Relies on **context switching**.
- No true parallelism—more like **interleaved execution**.
- Typical in systems with slow I/O and limited resources.

📌 Think of it as: juggling multiple programs but only one in hand at any moment.

## 🎛️ Multitasking

**Goal:** Allow users to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

- Subset of multiprogramming with emphasis on **responsiveness and interactivity**.
- Comes in two flavors:
    - **Preemptive multitasking** (e.g., modern OSes): OS forcibly switches between tasks.
    - **Cooperative multitasking** (e.g., early Windows/macOS): Tasks yield control voluntarily.
- Enables smooth user experience—e.g., writing code while listening to music.

📌 Think of it as: a time-sliced illusion of parallelism designed for user experience.

## 🧭 Multiprocessing

**Goal:** True parallel execution using multiple physical CPUs or cores.

- Each CPU/core can execute a process independently.
- Can be **symmetric (SMP)** or **asymmetric**:
    - SMP: all processors are peers.
    - Asymmetric: master-slave arrangement.
- Requires OS and hardware support for processor scheduling.
- Great for **compute-intensive tasks** and scalability.

📌 Think of it as: actual parallel paths—no illusion, full-on CPU party.

## 🧵 Multithreading

**Goal:** Increase efficiency by breaking a process into multiple threads.

- Threads share the same memory space, reducing overhead vs processes.
- Lightweight and faster context switches.
- Useful in apps like web servers (handling multiple connections) or games (graphics, physics, audio).
- Can be:
    - **User-level threads**: Managed by runtime libraries.
    - **Kernel-level threads**: Managed by OS, better for multicore CPUs.
- Often used in **parallelism within applications**, especially with **synchronization primitives** (mutexes, semaphores, etc.).

📌 Think of it as: having a crew working on different parts of the same project simultaneously.

## 🧩 Visual Summary

```
Multiprogramming: |A---|B---|C---| ← Only one active at a time; queue-based.
Multitasking:     |A--|B--|C--| ← Rapid switching for user responsiveness.
Multiprocessing:  CPU1: A   CPU2: B   CPU3: C ← True parallel execution.
Multithreading:   Proc A → [T1|T2|T3] ← Threads within one process working together.
```
