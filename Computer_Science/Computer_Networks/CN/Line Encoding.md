In LANs, the most common cable types are coaxial, twisted pair (UTP and STP), and fiber optic. Each cable type utilizes a specific line encoding mechanism to transmit data. 

Coaxial Cables: 

- **Line Encoding:**
    
    Coaxial cables primarily use Manchester encoding for Ethernet, which involves encoding data by having a voltage transition in the middle of each bit time. This ensures DC balance and provides clock recovery.
    
- **Applications:**
    
    Coaxial cables were historically used in early Ethernet standards like 10Base2 and 10Base5.
    

Twisted Pair Cables (UTP & STP):

- **Line Encoding:**
    
    Twisted pair cables, particularly for Gigabit Ethernet (1000BASE-T), often employ 4D-PAM5 (4-dimensional Pulse Amplitude Modulation with 5 levels). This encoding scheme uses five voltage levels (-2V, -1V, 0V, +1V, +2V) across four wire pairs to achieve higher data rates. 
    
- **Applications:**
    
    Twisted pair cables, including Cat5, Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6a, Cat7, and Cat8, are widely used for Ethernet connections in both homes and businesses. 
    

Fiber Optic Cables:

- **Line Encoding:**
    
    Fiber optic cables use various line encoding techniques, including Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) and Manchester encoding. NRZ is common for transmitting data over long distances, while Manchester encoding is used in some applications for better clock recovery and signal integrity. 
    
- **Applications:**
    
    Fiber optic cables are used for high-speed, long-distance data transmission in LANs, especially where high bandwidth and immunity to electromagnetic interference are required. 
    

Key Considerations:

- **Data Rate:**
    
    The choice of cable and encoding method depends on the desired data rate and distance. Higher-category twisted pair cables (Cat6a, Cat7, Cat8) and fiber optic cables offer higher bandwidth and data rates. 
    
- **Interference:**
    
    Twisted pair cables utilize twists in the wires to reduce interference and crosstalk. Fiber optic cables are inherently immune to electromagnetic interference. 
    
- **Cost and Installation:**
    
    Coaxial cables are generally cheaper and easier to install than fiber optic cables, but fiber optic cables offer better performance over longer distances.
