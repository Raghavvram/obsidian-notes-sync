## Step 1: Problem Definition

1. *Define the problem*: Clearly articulate the problem you're trying to solve.
2. *Identify the goal*: Determine what you want to achieve with your ML model.

## Step 2: Data Collection

1. *Gather data*: Collect relevant data from various sources.
2. *Ensure data quality*: Verify the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the data.

## Step 3: Data Preprocessing

1. *Clean the data*: Handle missing values, outliers, and errors.
2. *Transform the data*: Normalize, scale, or transform the data as needed.
3. *Feature engineering*: Extract relevant features from the data.

## Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. *Understand the data distribution*: Calculate summary statistics and visualize the data.
2. *Identify patterns and relationships*: Examine correlations, trends, and clusters.
3. *Detect anomalies and outliers*: Identify data points that are significantly different from the rest.

## Step 5: Data Split

1. *Split the data*: Divide the data into training, validation, and testing sets.
2. *Ensure representative splits*: Ensure the splits are representative of the overall data distribution.

## Step 6: Model Selection

1. *Choose a model*: Select a suitable ML algorithm based on the problem and data.
2. *Consider model complexity*: Balance model complexity with interpretability and computational resources.

## Step 7: Model Training

1. *Train the model*: Use the training data to train the model.
2. *Tune hyperparameters*: Optimize model hyperparameters for better performance.

## Step 8: Model Evaluation

1. *Evaluate the model*: Use the validation set to evaluate the model's performance.
2. *Metrics*: Calculate relevant metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Step 9: Model Deployment

1. *Deploy the model*: Integrate the trained model into a production-ready environment.
2. *Monitor performance*: Continuously monitor the model's performance and retrain as needed.

## Step 10: Model Maintenance

1. *Update the model*: Regularly update the model with new data and retrain as needed.
2. *Ensure model interpretability*: Provide insights into the model's decisions and predictions.

By following these mandatory steps, you can ensure that your ML project is well-structured, efficient, and effective.
