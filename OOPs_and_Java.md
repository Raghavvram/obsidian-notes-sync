##### Q) Can constructor have access modifiers in java

Yes, constructors in Java can have access modifiers. The purpose of these modifiers is to control the visibility and accessibility of the constructor, determining which other classes or packages can create instances of the class.

The available access modifiers for constructors are:

- `public`:
    
    A public constructor can be accessed and invoked from any class in any package. This is the most common access level for constructors.
    
- `protected`:
    
    A protected constructor can be accessed and invoked from classes within the same package, as well as by subclasses (even if they are in a different package).
    

- `default` (package-private):
    
    If no access modifier is specified, the constructor has default (package-private) access. This means it can only be accessed and invoked by classes within the same package.
    

- `private`:
    
    A private constructor can only be accessed and invoked from within the class itself. This is often used in design patterns like the Singleton pattern to restrict external instantiation of the class.
    

It is important to note that constructors cannot be declared with non-access modifiers such as `static`, `final`, or `abstract`. Constructors are specifically for initializing instances of a class, and these non-access modifiers are not applicable to their function.

##### Q) what is fully abstract class in java

In Java, the term "fully abstract class" is often used interchangeably with "interface." While abstract classes in Java can contain both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation), a "fully abstract class" implies a class where all methods are abstract and there are no concrete methods or instance variables. This aligns precisely with the definition and characteristics of a Java interface.

Here's why an interface is considered a "fully abstract class" in Java:

- **All methods are implicitly abstract:**
    
    Prior to Java 8, all methods declared in an interface were implicitly `public abstract`. Since Java 8, interfaces can also have `default` and `static` methods with implementations, but the core concept of an interface as a contract of abstract behavior remains.
    
- **Cannot be instantiated:**
    
    Like abstract classes, interfaces cannot be instantiated directly. You cannot create an object of an interface.
    
- **Provides a contract:**
    
    Interfaces define a contract that implementing classes must adhere to by providing implementations for all the abstract methods declared in the interface.
    
- **Achieves 100% abstraction:**
    
    By containing only abstract methods (or `default`/`static` methods that provide a common implementation for the interface itself), interfaces achieve a higher level of abstraction compared to abstract classes that can contain concrete methods.
    

In essence, when discussing a "fully abstract class" in Java, it is most commonly referring to an interface due to its inherent nature of containing only abstract method declarations (or methods with default/static implementations for the interface itself) and providing a blueprint for behavior without any concrete implementation details within the interface itself.

##### Q) what is partial abstraction in java
Partial abstraction in Java refers to the concept where a class provides some level of abstraction, but not complete abstraction. This is primarily achieved through the use of abstract classes.

Here's a breakdown:

- **Abstract Classes:**
    
    An abstract class in Java can have a mix of abstract methods (methods declared with the `abstract` keyword and no implementation) and concrete methods (regular methods with full implementation).
    
- **Partial Abstraction:**
    
    Because an abstract class can contain both abstract and concrete methods, it allows for partial abstraction. Some behaviors are defined and implemented within the abstract class (concrete methods), while other behaviors are left abstract, requiring subclasses to provide their own specific implementations (abstract methods).
    
- **Contrast with Interfaces:**
    
    Interfaces in Java, on the other hand, achieve 100% abstraction (before Java 8's default methods), as they traditionally only contain abstract methods and constants, without any implementation details. Subclasses implementing an interface must provide implementations for all its methods.
    
- **Purpose:**
    
    Partial abstraction is useful when you have a common set of behaviors that can be implemented in a base class, but also require subclasses to provide specific implementations for certain unique behaviors. This promotes code reuse and enforces a common structure while allowing for flexibility.
    
##### Q) why do we need interface or full abstraction
Interfaces and abstract classes are used to achieve abstraction, which simplifies complex systems by hiding unnecessary details and exposing only essential information. This allows for greater flexibility, maintainability, and reusability of code. Interfaces, in particular, enable multiple inheritance of behavior and promote loose coupling between classes, while abstract classes provide a base for shared functionality and enforce method implementation. 

Benefits of Abstraction:

- **Reduced Complexity:**
    
    Abstraction simplifies the user's view of a system by hiding internal complexities and presenting only necessary information. This makes it easier to understand, use, and maintain the system.
    
- **Increased Flexibility:**
    
    Abstraction allows for changes in the underlying implementation without affecting the user's interaction with the system. For example, a database can be switched without changing the application code that interacts with it through an interface.
    
- **Improved Reusability:**
    
    Abstraction enables code reuse by defining common behaviors and interfaces that can be implemented by different classes or components.
    
- **Enhanced Maintainability:**
    
    Abstraction makes it easier to modify or update the system, as changes can be localized to specific components without affecting the entire system.
    
##### Q) why do we need abstract class when we have interface

Abstract classes and interfaces both serve as blueprints for classes, but they differ in their purpose and capabilities. Abstract classes allow for both method declarations and implementations, as well as state (instance variables), while interfaces primarily define a contract of methods without implementation. While interfaces are useful for achieving loose coupling and multiple inheritance, abstract classes offer a way to share common functionality and enforce a specific structure among related classes. 

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

Abstract Classes:

- **Purpose:**
    
    Define a common structure and behavior for a group of related classes, allowing for code reuse and a hierarchical relationship. 
    
- **Features:**
    
    - Can contain both abstract methods (methods without implementation) and concrete methods (methods with implementation). 
    - May have instance variables (state). 
    - Can have constructors. 
    - A class can only extend one abstract class (single inheritance). 
    
- **Use Cases:**
    
    - When you want to provide a default implementation for some methods while forcing subclasses to implement others. 
    - When you need to share common state (instance variables) among related classes. 
    - When you want to enforce a specific hierarchy and structure for your classes. 
    

Interfaces:

- **Purpose:**
    
    Define a contract of methods that a class must implement, regardless of whether the classes are related. 
    
- **Features:**
    
    - Only contain abstract methods (before Java 8, where default and static methods were introduced). 
    - Cannot have instance variables (state). 
    - A class can implement multiple interfaces (multiple inheritance). 
    
- **Use Cases:**
    
    - When you want to define a contract for behavior without dictating implementation. 
    - When you want to achieve loose coupling and allow multiple inheritance-like behavior. 
    - When you want to define behavior across unrelated classes. 
    

When to choose which:

- **Use an abstract class when:**
    
    You want to provide a base implementation and structure for a group of related classes, and you need to share some state (instance variables).
    
- **Use an interface when:**
    
    You want to define a contract for behavior that can be implemented by unrelated classes, and you want to achieve loose coupling through multiple inheritance

##### Q) what kind of access modifiers does abstract class support

Abstract classes in Java (and similar languages) support several access modifiers, including public, protected, and default (package-private) for class members (fields, methods, etc.). However, abstract methods within an abstract class cannot be private. 

Here's a breakdown:

- **Public:**
    
    Members declared as public are accessible from anywhere, including subclasses and other parts of the code. 
    
- **Protected:**
    
    Members declared as protected are accessible within the same package and by subclasses, even if they are in different packages. 
    
- **Default (Package-private):**
    
    If no access modifier is specified, the member has default (package-private) access. It's accessible only within the same package. 
    
- **Private:**
    
    Private members are only accessible within the declaring class itself and are not accessible from subclasses or other classes. 
    

Key points about abstract classes and access modifiers:

- Abstract classes themselves can be declared as `public` or `default` (package-private). 
- Abstract methods cannot be `private` because they need to be overridden by subclasses to provide concrete implementations. 
- Abstract methods can be `protected` or `default` (package-private) or `public`. 
- Abstract classes can have constructors, and these constructors can use the usual access modifiers like `public`, `protected`, and `private` (for internal use). 

In essence, while abstract classes can have a wide range of access modifiers for their members, the restriction on `private` for abstract methods ensures that subclasses are obligated to provide concrete implementations for those methods.

**Abstract classes can also have final, nonfinal, static and nonstatic variables**, whereas an interface has only static and final variables. Additionally, abstract methods can define public, protected and private concrete methods, while interfaces have all fields as automatically public, static and final.
